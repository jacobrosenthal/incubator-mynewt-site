## Enabling an Off-Board Sensor in an Existing Application

This tutorial shows you how to enable an existing application to run on a device with an off-board sensor device connected to it. It allows you to quickly bring up and run a Mynewt application on a device to view sensor data from a sensor device.   

We use the **sensors_test** application running on an nRF52-DK board to communicate, via the I2C interface,  with the [Adafruit BNO055](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/overview) sensor. The sensors_test application is a sample application that demonstrates all the features of the Mynewt OS sensor framework. The application includes the sensor framework `sensor` shell command that allows you to view the sensors and sensor data managed by the sensor framework, and the `bno055` shell command that allows you to control and query the BNO055 device and to view the sensor data.

<br>

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Create and build the application and bootloader targets.
* Connect a BNO055 sensor device to an nRF52-DK board.
* Run `sensor` and `bno055` shell commands to view the sensor data and control the bno055 sensor device.

### Prerequisites

* Meet the prerequisites listed in [Sensor Tutorials](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensors.md).
* Have a Nordic nRF52-DK board.
* Have an [Adafruit BNO055](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/overview) sensor.
* Have a [serial port setup](/os/get_started/serial_access.md).
* Install the [Segger JLINK software and documentation pack](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html).


### Description of the Packages Needed for the Sample Application

The sensors_test application includes all the packages, and sets the syscfg settings to values, that are required to enable the full set of sensor framework features.  This tutorial uses a subset of the sensors_test application functionality because the objective of the tutorial is to show you how to quickly bring up the sensors_test application and use the `sensor` and `bno055` shell commands to view the sensor data from the BNO055 sensor.  The instructions in this tutorial show the syscfg settings that must be enabled in the sensors_test application to demonstrate the examples shown. The instructions do not explicity exclude the packages or change the syscfg setting values to disable the functionality that is not used in the sensors_test application. 

For your reference, we describe the packages and the setting values that enable the application functionality that this tutorial demonstrates: 

* **hw/sensor**: The sensor framework package. This package defines the `SENSOR_CLI` setting that specifies whether the `sensor` shell command is enabled. This setting is enabled by default.

* **hw/sensors/creator**: The sensor creator package. This package supports off-board sensor devices.  This package creates the os devices in the kernel for the sensors and configures the sensor devices with default values. It defines a syscfg setting for each sensor device and uses the naming convention `<SENSORNAME>_OFB`.  For example, the syscfg setting for the BNO055 sensor is  `BNO055_OFB`.  The `<SENSORNAME>_OFB` setting specifies whether the sensor named SENSORNAME is enabled. The setting is disabled by default. This package includes the sensor device driver package `hw/drivers/sensors/<sensorname>` and creates and configures a sensor named SENSORNAME when the `SENSORNAME_OFB` setting is enabled by the application. 
* **hw/drivers/sensors/bno055**: The driver package for the BNO055 sensor. The creator package adds this package as a package dependency when the `BNO055_OFB` setting is enabled. The driver package defines the `BNO055_CLI` setting that specfies whether the `bno055` shell command is enabled. This setting is disabled by default and is enabled by the application.  The package also exports the `bno055_shell_init()` function that an application calls to initialize the driver shell support. The sensor_test application enables this setting by default and calls the `bno055_shell_init()` function.

	**Note:** All sensor driver packages that support a sensor shell command define a syscfg setting to specify whether the shell command is enabled. They also export a shell initialization function that an application must call. The naming convention is `<SENSORNAME>_CLI` for the syscfg setting  and `<sensorname>_shell_init()` for the initialization function. 


* **sys/shell** and **sys/console/full**: The shell and console packages for shell support over the console. The `SHELL_TASK` setting needs to be set to enable the shell support in the package. The sensors_test application enables this setting by default.
<br>

<br>
### Step 1: Creating the Application Target
In this step, you create a target for the sensors_test application that enables  the BNO055 off-board sensor. 

To add the BNO055 sensor support, you create the application target with the following syscfg settings enabled:

* `I2C_0`: Enables the I2C interface 0 in the nRF52 BSP HAL setting.
* `BNO055_OFB`: Enables support for the BNO055 sensor in the sensor creator package (`hw/sensor/creator`).  
When this setting is enabled, the creator package performs the following:  

	* Includes the BNO055 driver package (`hw/drivers/sensors/bno055`) as a package dependency.
	* Creates an os device for the sensor in the Mynewt kernel.
	* Configures the sensor device with default values.


**Note:** The following two settings enable sensor framework and sensor device shell support: 

* `SENSOR_CLI`: Specifies whether the `sensor` shell command is enabled in the sensor framework package.  

* `BNO055_CLI`: Specifies whether the `bno055` shell command is enabled in the bno055 device driver package.  The sensor_test application also uses this setting to conditionally include the call to the `bno055_shell_init()` function to initialize the shell support in the driver.


This tutorial uses both shell commands. They are enabled by default so you do not need to explicitly enable the setting for this target.

<br> 
1. Run the `newt target create` command, from your project base directory,  to create the target. We name the target `nrf52_bno055_test`:
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt target create nrf52_bno055_test
Target targets/nrf52_bno055_test successfully created
$

```

<br>
2. Run the `newt target set` command to set the app, bsp, and build_profile variables for the target: 
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt target set nrf52_bno055_test app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/sensors_test bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk build_profile=debug 
Target targets/nrf52_bno055_test successfully set target.app to @apache-mynewt-core/apps/sensors_test
Target targets/nrf52_bno055_test successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk
Target targets/nrf52_bno055_test successfully set target.build_profile to debug

$
```

<br>
3. Run the `newt target set` command to enable the `I2C_0` and `BNO055_OFB` syscfg settings:

```no-highlight

$ newt target set nrf52_bno055_test syscfg=BNO055_OFB=1:I2C_0=1
Target targets/nrf52_bno055_test successfully set target.syscfg to BNO055_OFB=1:I2C_0=1
$

```

<br>
4. You can run the `newt target show` command to verify the target settings:

```no-highlight

$ newt target show nrf52_bno055_test
targets/nrf52_bno055_test
    app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/sensors_test
    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk
    build_profile=debug
    syscfg=BNO055_OFB=1:I2C_0=1
$

```
<br>
### Step 2: <a name="create_targets"></a>Creating the Bootloader Target
<br>
1. Run the following `newt target` commands, from your project directory, to create a bootloader target. We name the target `nrf52_boot`:
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt target create nrf52_boot
Target targets/nrf52_boot successfully created 
$ newt target set nrf52_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk  build_profile=optimized
Target targets/nrf52_boot successfully set target.app to @apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot
Target targets/nrf52_boot successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk
Target targets/nrf52_boot successfully set target.build_profile to optimized
$

```
<br>
2. You can run the `newt target show` command to verify the target settings:
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt target show nrf52_boot
targets/nrf52_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot
    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk
    build_profile=optimized
$
```
<br>
### Step 3: Building the Bootloader and Application Image
<br>
1. Run the `newt build nrf52_boot` command to build the bootloader:

```no-highlight
$ newt build nrf52_boot

<br>

### Step 4: Creating and Signing the Application Image 

Run the `newt create-image` command to create and sign image. You may assign an arbitrary version (e.g. 1.0.0) to the image.
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt create-image nrf52_bno055_test 1.0.0
App image succesfully generated: /Users/wanda/dev/myproj/bin/targets/nrf52_bno055_test/app/apps/sensors_test/sensors_test.img

```
<br>


### Step 5:  Connecting the BNO055 Sensor to the nRF52-DK Board
Connect the pins from the BNO055 sensor to the nRF52-DK board as specified in the following table:

|Lines| BNO055 Pin | nRF52-DK Pin|
|-----|-------|---------|
|Power| Vin  |  5V     |
|Clock| SCL   |  P0.27|
|Data | SDA   |  P0.26|
|Ground| GND  |  GND|


![Alt Layout - BNO055](/os/tutorials/pics/BNO055_small.jpg) 
![Alt Layout - NRF52_IC2](/os/tutorials/pics/NRF52_I2C_small.jpg)


<br>
### Step 6: Connecting the nRF52-DK Board to your Computer 
<br>
1. Set up two connections between your computer and the nRF52-DK board:  

* A serial connection to communicate with the sensor_tests application and view the sensor data and hardware information via the Mynewt Shell.

	You can reference the [Serial Port Setup](../get_started/serial_access.md) Tutorial for more information on setting up the serial communication.

* A connection from your computer to the micro-USB port on the nRF52-DK board to power the board and to load the bootloader and application image.

<br>
2. Turn the power on the board to ON. You should see the green LED light up on the board.

<br>
### Step 7: Loading the Bootloader and the Application Image
<br>
1. Run the `newt load nrf52_boot` command to load the bootloader onto the board:
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt load nrf52_boot
Loading bootloader
$

```
<br>
2. Run the `newt load nrf52_bno055_test` command to load the application image on to the board:
<br>
```no-highlight

$ newt load nrf52_bno055_test
Loading app image into slot 1
$ 
```
<br>
3. Power the nRF52-DK board OFF and ON.
<br>
### Step 8: Using a Terminal Emulator to Connect to the Application Console

Start up a terminal emulator to connect the sensors_tests application console. You can use one of the terminal emulators listed below or one of your choice:

* On Mac OS and Linux platforms, you can run ```minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-<port> -b 115200``` to connect to the console of your app. Note that on Linux, the format of the port name is `/dev/ttyUSB<N>`, where N is a number.

* On Windows, you can use a terminal application such as PuTTY to connect to the device.

	If you located your port from a MinGW terminal,  the port name format is `/dev/ttyS<N>`, where `N` is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: `/dev/ttyS<N>` maps to `COM<N+1>`. For example, `/dev/ttyS2` maps to  `COM3`.

	You can also use the Windows Device Manager to locate the COM port.

<br>
We use minicom for this tutorial. After minicom connects, enter &lt;return&gt; to ensure the shell is running.  You should see the `compat>` prompt:

```no-highlight

Welcome to minicom 2.7.1

010674 compat> 
```
<br>
### Step 9: Viewing the Registered Sensors and Sensor Data 
The sensor framework package implements the `sensor` shell command. This command allows you to:

* List all the registered sensor devices.
* View the sensor types that a registered sensor device supports.
* Read sensor data samples.

To view the command syntax, enter `sensor`

```no-highlight

010674 compat> sensor
016726 Possible commands for sensor are:
016727   list
016727       list of sensors registered
016728   read <sensor_name> <type> [-n nsamples] [-i poll_itvl(ms)] [-d poll_du]
016730       read <no_of_samples> from sensor<sensor_name> of type:<type> at pr 
016733       at <poll_interval> rate for <poll_duration>  type <sensor_name>
016735       types supported by registered sensor
016736 compat> 

```
<br>
####Listing the Registered Sensors<br>
You use the `sensor list` command to list all the registered sensor devices:
<br>
```no-highlight

031798 compat> sensor list
129441 sensor dev = bno055_0, configured type = 0x1 0x2 0x4 0x200 0x1000 0x2000 
129444 compat> 

```

The output shows one sensor, **bno055_0**, registered, and the configured types for the sensor. A configure type is a subset of the types that a sensor supports.

<br>

####Listing the Types that a Sensor Supports 

You use the `sensor type` command to list the types that a sensor supports:

```no-highlight

031822 compat> sensor type bno055_0                                             
033156 sensor dev = bno055_0,
type =
033157     accelerometer: 0x1                                               
033157     magnetic field: 0x2                                                  
033158     gyroscope: 0x4                                                       
033159     temperature: 0x10                                                    
033160     vector: 0x200                                                        
033160     accel: 0x1000                                                        
033161     gravity: 0x2000                                                      
033162     euler: 0x4000    

```

<br>
####Viewing Sensor Data Samples
You use the `sensor read` command to read data samples for a configured type. You can specify the number of samples to read, a poll interval, and a poll duration. You can only view sensor data for the sensor types that a sensor device is configured for.

**Example 1:** Read 5 samples of accelerometer data from the **bno055_0** sensor:

```no-highlight

### Step 10: Controlling and Viewing Sensor Device Hardware and Sensor Data
The BNO055 device driver implements the `bno055` shell command that allows you to:

* Read sensor data samples for all the sensor type that the device supports. 
  
    **Note:** The `sensor` shell command discussed previously only reads sensor data for configured sensor types.

* Query the chip id, sensor revisions, content of registers, sensor offsets.
* Reset the device.
* Change the power mode.
* Change the operation mode.
<br>

Enter `bno055` to see the command syntax:

### Next Steps

Now that you have successfully enabled an application to communicate with a sensor,  We recommend that you:

* Experiment with other `sensor` and `bno055` shell commands in this tutorial to view other types of sensor data.
* Change the default configuration values for the sensor. See the [Changing the Default Configuration for a Sensor](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_offboard_config.md) tutorial.
* Try a different off-board sensor. You can follow most of the procedures in this tutorial to enable other sensors in the sensors_test application. The `syscfg.yml` file for the `hw/sensor/creator/` package specifies the off-board sensors that Mynewt currently supports.  You will need to:
    * Enable the `<SENSOR_NAME>_OFB` setting to include the sensor driver package and to create and initialize the sensor device.
    * Enable the correct interface in the nRF52 BSP to communicate with the sensor device.
    * Enable the sensor device driver shell command if the driver supports the shell. You can check the `syscfg.yml` file for the sensor driver package in the `hw/drivers/sensor/<sensor_name>` directory.
* Try one of the other sensor tutorials listed in the [Sensor Tutorial Overview](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensors.md).
